YaYa Wallet - Full-Stack Engineer Coding Test
This Mini project implements a transaction monitoring dashboard using the YaYa Wallet API. It allows users to view and search their transactions in a responsive, user-friendly interface.
________________________________________
üöÄ** **Features****
1. Transaction Table with:
      o Transaction ID, Sender, Receiver, Amount, Currency, Cause, Created At
2. Pagination (p query param for page number)
3. Search by sender name, receiver name, cause, or ID
4. Incoming/Outgoing Indicators
      o Incoming: current user is the receiver
      o Outgoing: current user is the sender
      o Top-up: sender = receiver ‚Üí considered incoming
5. Responsive UI (works across devices)
6. Secure API Handling (keys/secret stored safely in environment variables)

üß©** **Problem-Solving Methodology****

1. Understanding the Requirements ‚Äì Identified core features: transaction table, search, pagination, visual indicators, responsiveness, and API security.

2. Planning the Solution ‚Äì Chose React.js frontend for UI and Node.js + Express.js backend for secure API handling. Planned reusable components for table, pagination, and search.

3. Implementation ‚Äì Developed backend proxy to handle API requests; implemented frontend components with conditional styling for incoming, outgoing, and top-up transactions.

4. Testing ‚Äì Verified API integration, pagination, search functionality, and responsive layout across devices.

5. Security Considerations ‚Äì Kept API credentials in .env, ensured frontend communicates only with backend.

6. Final Review ‚Äì Cleaned and refactored code, ensured descriptive variable names, and wrote README for setup instructions.

üì¶ **Installation & Setup**
1.	Clone this repo:
    ‚Ä¢	git clone https://github.com/dese1849/YaYa-PII-SC---Full-stack-Developer-Coding-Test.git
    ‚Ä¢	cd YaYa-PII-SC---Full-stack-Developer-Coding-Test
2.	Install dependencies:
    ‚Ä¢	npm install
3.	Create .env file in root with:
    ‚Ä¢	API_KEY=your_api_key
    ‚Ä¢	API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    ‚Ä¢	BASE_URL=https://sandbox.yayawallet.com/api/en
4.	Run Front End server:
    ‚Ä¢	npm run dev
5.	Backend server:
    ‚Ä¢	Node Server.js
________________________________________
üîç** **Testing the Solution**
    1. Open the dashboard in browser.
    2. Use the search bar to query by  sender, receiver, ID or cause.
    3. Use pagination controls to navigate pages.
    4. Check visual indicators:
            o	Green = Incoming
            o	Red = Outgoing
________________________________________
üîí **Security**
    1. API credentials are stored in .env.
    2. .env is ignored via .gitignore.
________________________________________
**Assumptions**
    1. Authentication guide from YaYa Wallet API was followed.
    2. currentUserAccount is predefined in Dhashborad Page with the name of  "yayawalletpi" (for identifying incoming/outgoing transactions).
    3. Basic error handling for API failures is included.
